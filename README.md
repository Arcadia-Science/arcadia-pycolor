Note: Analysis repo names should be prefixed with the year (ie `2024-noveltree-analysis`)

## Purpose

TODO: Briefly describe the core analyses performed in the repository and the motivation behind them.

## Installation and Setup

This repository uses conda to manage software environments and installations. You can find operating system-specific instructions for installing miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). After installing conda and [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), run the following command to create the pipeline run environment.

```{bash}
TODO: Replace <NAME> with the name of your environment
mamba env create -n <NAME> --file envs/dev.yml
conda activate <NAME>
```

**Tips for Developers**

You can use the following command to export your current conda environment to a `yml` file.  
This command will only export the packages that you have installed directly, not the ones that were installed as dependencies. When you're ready to share, please delete this section.

```{bash}
conda env export --from-history --no-builds > envs/dev.yml
```

## Data

TODO: Add details about the description of input / output data and links to Zenodo depositions, if applicable.

## For Developers

This section contains information for developers who are working off of this template. Please delete this section when you're ready to share your repository.

### GitHub templates
This template uses GitHub templates to provide checklists when making new pull requests. These templates are stored in the [.github/](./.github/) directory.

### VSCode
This template includes recommendations to VSCode users for extensions, particularly the `ruff` linter. These recommendations are stored in `.vscode/extensions.json`. When you open the repository in VSCode, you should see a prompt to install the recommended extensions. 

### `.gitignore`
This template uses a `.gitignore` file to prevent certain files from being committed to the repository.

### `pyproject.toml`
`pyproject.toml` is a configuration file to specify your project's metadata and to set the behavior of other tools such as linters, type checkers etc. You can learn more [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)

### Linting
This template automates linting and formatting using GitHub Actions and the `ruff` linter. When you push changes to your repository, GitHub will automatically run the linter and report any errors, blocking merges until they are resolved.
